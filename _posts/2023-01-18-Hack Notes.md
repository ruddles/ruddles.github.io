title: Hack Notes

Last year I ran through a lot of CTF challenges and made it into the top 1% of TryHackMe.  Along with that I wrote a tonne of notes on commands used, which I've now added to a repo on github.  I plan on adding to this over the next few months, documenting techniques and adding deeper dives into tooling.
